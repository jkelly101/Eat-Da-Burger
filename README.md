## Usage

The User adds the name of the burger they want to the Menu by typing it into the input bar and clicking the `Add Burger` button. The burger name they entered will appear in the right-hand column labeled `Menu` with a `Devour it!` button. The User can click on the `Devour It` button when they have eaten the burger and the burger name will then appear in the right-hand column labeled `Burgers You Have Devoured`. The data is stored in local storage whether devoured or not and will re-populate upon page reload.
